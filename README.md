# quizz-histart
An HTML, CSS and JS application

A first effort HTML page. It's about a quizz, proposing the user to answer 10 questions in History of Art. The page works using external CSS and JS files. The page is poorly coded, and my intent is to turn this amateur job into a decent interactive page.
